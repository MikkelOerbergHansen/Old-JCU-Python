the program loads a list of songs
and lets the user choose between

- add a song to list
- mark a song as being learned
- quitting the program

when user chooses to display a list
the list is sorted by artist.
when the user chooses to add a song to the list
the input is error checked:
- no duplicate songs of title and artists
- input can not be blank
- and year of the song has to be a number of 4 digits and non-negative
when the user chooses to mark a song as learned
it checks if there are any songs left to be chosen and
it checks if user chooses a song that has not been learned yet.
it also checks for valid numbers.

after a choice the main menu is displayed asking for a new
choice. except if the choice is to quit, then the song list is saved
and the program stops.
